        <center><p> my name is Alexandre Jiresse Lusa, and I am currently studying Web Development at BYU-Idaho.
            I have always been interested in technology, and this course is allowing me to expand my knowledge
            in web design and development. my goal is to work as a front-end developer, creating user-friendly
            websites and applications. In my free time, I enjoy learning new programming languages, experimenting
            with design tools, and contributing to open-source projects. I look forward to honing my skills in HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript as I continue this course and work towards my career goals.
